# VR Funding Platform: For Client SIXR

SIXR is a tech non profit organization based in Seattle. They help underrepresented groups who wouldn’t otherwise have access to technology. One example is helping minorities build virtual reality experiences to tell their story, building empathy and understanding. They work primarily with underrepresented group who wouldn’t otherwise have access to this kind of technology.  They want to build a platform that provides tech entrepreneurs with limited resources access to business training, project capital raising, and mentoring.

The first step of the platform is building the ability to raise capital for new tech projects. Ilhan, who is a high school dropout, has a keen interest in starting her own business in the emerging technology sector. She can log in to her account and create a project to start fundraising for it. Those with funding can come to the site and browse projects looking to raise capital.
